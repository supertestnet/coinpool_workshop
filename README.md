A workshop on how to make your own coinpool

Special thanks to [stutxo](https://github.com/stutxo/) for inspiring me to make this with his excellent [grugpool](https://github.com/stutxo/op_ctv_payment_pool), and for the two geniuses Jeremy Rubin and Gregory Maxwell for coming up with the idea of coinpools
